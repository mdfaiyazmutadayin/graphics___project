# War Scenario Graphics Project (C++)

This project simulates a war scenario using C++ and graphics programming. The goal is to create a visual representation of a fictional war, including different elements like soldiers, tanks, explosions, and terrain. This project provides a basic framework for visualizing complex scenarios in a 2D or 3D environment using graphics libraries.


## Features

- **War simulation**: Simulate battles between different forces, such as soldiers, tanks, and other vehicles.
- **Dynamic animations**: Animations for movement, explosions, and interactions.
- **Terrain generation**: Generate terrains with hills, rivers, and roads, which influence the battlefield.
- **Graphics Rendering**: Built using graphics libraries for 2D visualization.
